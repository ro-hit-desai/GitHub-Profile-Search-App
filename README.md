# GitHub Profile Search App 🔍

A modern Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that allows users to search GitHub profiles and view repositories with seamless offline caching and beautiful Material Design 3 interface.

## 🚀 Features

- **GitHub API Integration** - Fetches repository data from GitHub's REST API
- **Offline Caching** - Room database for persistent local storage
- **Modern UI** - Built with Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3
- **Dark/Light Theme** - Full theme support with smooth transitions
- **Real-time Search** - Filter repositories by name or ID
- **WebView Integration** - Direct browser access to repository URLs
- **Error Handling** - Graceful network failure management
- **Dependency Injection** - Hilt for clean architecture

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture & Patterns
- **MVVM Architecture** - Following Google's recommended architecture guidelines
- **Repository Pattern** - Clean separation of data layers
- **Dependency Injection** - Hilt for modular and testable code
- **State Management** - ViewModel with StateFlow for UI state
- **Single Activity** - Activity responsible only for UI-related code

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: 100% Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Networking**: Retrofit + Kotlin Coroutines
- **Database**: Room for local caching
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **Navigation**: Compose Navigation
- **Theming**: Material Design 3

## 📱 API Integration

### GitHub API Endpoint

GET https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:swift&sort=stars&order=desc


### API Response Structure
The API returns a paginated list of repositories with the following key fields used in the app:

```json
{
  "total_count": 1,
  "incomplete_results": false,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 123456789,
      "name": "awesome-repo",
      "html_url": "https://github.com/user/awesome-repo",
      "owner": {
        "login": "username"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


###  Data Model

data class GHRepo(
    val id: Long,
    val name: String,
    @SerializedName("html_url")
    val repoURL: String,
    val owner: Owner
)

data class Owner(
    val login: String
)

🔧 Core Components
Network Service

class NetworkService {
    suspend fun fetchRepositories(): Result<List<GHRepo>>
}



Caching Strategy
Room Database for local storage

Automatic cache updates on successful API responses

Fallback to cached data during network failures

Efficient data retrieval with proper indexing

UI Components
RepositoryListScreen - Main list with search functionality

RepositoryItem - Individual repository card

WebViewScreen - In-app browser for repository URLs

SearchBar - Real-time filtering component

🎨 UI/UX Features
Material Design 3 - Modern design language

Dark/Light Theme - Automatic theme switching

Smooth Animations - List transitions and state changes

Responsive Layout - Adapts to different screen sizes

Loading States - Skeleton loading during data fetch

Error States - User-friendly error messages

📦 Dependency Management
The project uses Hilt for dependency injection with the following key modules:

NetworkModule - Retrofit and API service

DatabaseModule - Room database and DAOs

RepositoryModule - Data repository bindings

ViewModelModule - ViewModel factory injections
